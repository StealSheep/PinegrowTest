  "ai-project-brief": "My Badass Company, a humorous brand site offering quirky services. Clean and modern design with bold accents that balance professionalism and playful irreverence while keeping layouts simple, structured, and easy to scan. Features a black and white base palette with a bold accent color such as electric blue or neon green to highlight key calls-to-action and important interface elements, with sans-serif typography that is clean and medium-large for a modern, highly legible reading experience. Responsive design will use flexible grids, scalable typography, and touch-friendly interactions to ensure consistent usability and visual impact across all devices. IMPORTANT: All section background images will use creative means (dimmed background, text boxes, effects...) to ensure optimal text visibility and readability. Furthermore, the website's visual identity will exclusively use imagery related to humorous representations of our various services, including playful scenes of exaggerated “badass” office work, comedic depictions of everyday business tasks, tongue-in-cheek service illustrations, and lighthearted visual metaphors for productivity and problem-solving, ensuring a cohesive and authentic brand experience that feels bold, fun, and unmistakably on-brand while still being clear and easy to understand for visitors.",
